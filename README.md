# 3D Printing Portal
A portal that allows manufacturing companies to upload 3D models of their products, and to get quotes and place orders for 3D printing services.

## Functionalitis:
### Frontend: 
- 3D Model Viewer: Allows users to view and interact with 3D models in a web-based interface, including the ability to rotate, zoom, and pan the models.
- File Upload and Management: Allows users to upload and store 3D models on the portal, with options for organizing and categorizing models.
- Responsiveness

### Backend:
- Database Management: A database to store and manage all of the data associated with the portal, such as user information, 3D model files, and print job data.
- Model Processing: Includes the capability to process and convert 3D model files into a format that can be printed by the connected 3D printers.
- User Authentication and Authorization: Provides secure user authentication and authorization, with options for managing user roles and permissions.

## Basic Tech:
### Frontend:
- A front-end framework such as React or Angular can be used to develop the front-end of the app.
- 3D Model Viewer: A 3D model viewer library such as Three.js or Babylon.js can be used to enable users to view and interact with 3D models in the app.

### Backend: 
- Web Framework: A web framework such as Ruby on Rails, Django, or Express.js can be used to develop the backend of the app.

### Database:  
- Cloud services: Cloud services such as AWS, Azure or Google Cloud can be used to host the application, store files and manage the data.
- Database: A database management system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB can be used to store and manage the data for the app.
